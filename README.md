# Duck Duck Quiz

## About the project
Duck Duck Quiz uses the MEVN stack to create a quiz game. It also uses Socket.io to connect the quiz attendees together.

## Instructions
You can either host a quiz or join a quiz. To host a quiz, login, visit the Host tab, and select a quiz. A random join code will be generated that you can share with others to join.

Once the quiz begins, the host has ability to select the correct answer, which will award points to the user. At the end of the quiz, the user with the most correct answers wins!
